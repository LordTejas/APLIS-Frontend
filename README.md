## Project Overview

**Major Project 21CSA399A**  
**Proposal (Individual Mode)**

- **Title:** AI-Powered Learning and Information System (APLIS)
- **Student Name:** Tejas Tukaram Kanji
- **Roll No.:** AA.SC.U3CSC2107103

## Abstract

APLIS aims to develop an AI-powered student-teacher portal that integrates full-stack engineering with the MERN stack, cloud services, and AI/ML capabilities. The portal features separate access points for students and staff, alongside an independent yet integrated ticket system for issue reporting. Utilizing Next.js for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, MongoDB for data storage, and various AI/ML models, APLIS offers personalized learning recommendations, performance prediction, and automated grading. The goal is to create a seamless and efficient platform for educational management and personalized learning.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
